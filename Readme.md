# AWS Amplify Gen 2 Data Hello

This next generation of Amplify’s backend building experience lets you author your frontend and backend definition completely with TypeScript, a file convention, and Git branch-based environments. To learn more, visit [AWS Amplify Gen 2](https://docs.amplify.aws).

This repo manages the data within Amplify. Data is responsible for managing graphql build and transformation processes, generating resources to deploy into your cloud stack in order to compute and store data for your graphql and REST endpoints, and providing inputs to codegen processes for use later in your end application.

## Quickstart

To get started with Amplify Gen 2, visit [AWS Amplify Gen 2 Quickstart](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/start).

```bash
npm create amplify@latest
```
