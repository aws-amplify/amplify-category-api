# AWS Amplify API Category

The AWS Amplify CLI is a toolchain which includes a robust feature set for simplifying mobile and web application development. The CLI uses AWS CloudFormation and nested stacks to allow you to add or modify configurations locally before you push them for execution in your account.

- [Changelog](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-category-api/releases/latest)

This repo manages the API category within Amplify CLI. The Category is responsible for managing graphql build and transformation processes, generating resources to deploy into your cloud stack in order to compute and store data for your graphql and REST endpoints, and providing inputs to codegen processes for use later in your end application.

## Install the CLI

- Requires Node.jsÂ® version 18 or later

Install and configure the Amplify CLI as follows:

```bash
$ npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
$ amplify configure
```

**_Note_**: If you're having permission issues on your system installing the CLI, please try the following command:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli --unsafe-perm=true
$ amplify configure
```

## Developing

To set up your local development environment, go to [Local Environment Setup](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-category-api/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#local-environment-setup).

To test your category, do the following:

```sh
cd <your-test-front-end-project>
amplify-dev init
amplify-dev <your-category> <subcommand>
```

Before pushing code or sending a pull request, do the following:

- At the command line, run `yarn lint` at the top-level directory. This invokes eslint to check for lint errors in all of our packages.
- You can use `yarn lint` to find some of the lint errors. To attempt fix them, go to the package that has errors and run `yarn lint-fix`
- If there are any remaining lint errors, resolve them manually. Linting your code is a best practice that ensures good code quality so it's important that you don't skip this step.
